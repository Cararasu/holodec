next planned

detect what regs are written and read for every register
	written/read:
		unknown/none/used/functionused
		Lattice?:
			unknown -> functionused
			functionused -> none/used
	none written / none read -> no change
	used read -> input param
	used written -> return param
	
recursively apply this informations so that only used or none remains

detect memory on the stack that is written to and read from
	
parse c/c++ files to generate function types for dynamically loaded functions
